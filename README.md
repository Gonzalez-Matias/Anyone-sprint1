# NBA Sprint Project: Data gathering
In this project I will rely heavily in the use of API as data sources. Contrary to most machine learning challenges and competitions, working in the industry usually requires the ML Developer to work with multiple teams and use heterogeneous sources of information to get the necessary data to solve a particular problem. Access to data is often provided through application programming interfaces (APIs), whether internal or external to the organization. It is very important to understand how to interact with APIs to collect data in our day to day work.

## Parts

The project is divided in 3 main parts:
* Collecting information for building our dataset
* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
* Analyzing and Visualizing data

### Collecting information for building our dataset

Here I'm only going to work on collecting the necessary raw data to build the required dataset, generate the appropiate fields and merge the data into a single dataframe.

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Here I'll make sure that every column has the correct type and add some new columns.

### Analyzing and Visualizing data
 
I'll get some minors statistics about the NBA players and I'll perform graphics that will help in the next part of the project where I'll have to train an ML model that predicts the player's salary.

##  Files

There is an .ipynb file of the project called AnyoneAI_Project_1.ipynb.
The repository contains a group of .csv files that were generated with the different endpoints of NBA API so in case they stop working the .ipynb can still get the data from here.
There is also a folder with the data necessary to generate a map in the .ipynb.

## Next Part

In another repository, I'll be continuing with the ML model where I'll use some linear models such as SGDRegressor and also some Non Linear model like DecisionTreeRegressor.
