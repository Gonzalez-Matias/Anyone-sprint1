# NBA Sprint Project

In this project I will rely heavily in the use of API as data sources. Contrary to most machine learning challenges and competitions, working in the industry usually requires the ML Developer to work with multiple teams and use heterogeneous sources of information to get the necessary data to solve a particular problem. Access to data is often provided through application programming interfaces (APIs), whether internal or external to the organization. It is very important to understand how to interact with APIs to collect data in our day to day work.

## Parts

The project is divided in 3 main parts:
* Collecting information for building our dataset
* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
*  Analyzing and Visualizing data

### Create files and folders

Here I'm only going to work on collecting the necessary raw data to build the required dataset, generate the appropiate fields and merge the data into a single dataframe.

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Here I'll make sure that every column has the correct type and add some new columns.

### Analyzing and Visualizing data
 
I'll get some minors statistics about the NBA players and I'll perform graphics that will help in the next part of the project where I'll have to train an ML model that predicts the player's salary
